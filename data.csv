                           I have recommended this particular interview to my friends . We all completed our university degrees close to half a century ago , but still maintain a keen interest in world affairs and read widely . Regrettably , I fear that education standards have declined over the years .  One need only observe the appalling standard of our public debate , riddled as it is with poorly informed pseudo-intellectual commentators arrogantly speaking nonsense . We can laugh at some of the biased and illogical arguments of the deluded , but it is foolish to laugh when such drivel becomes dangerous  . We then need courageous folk to speak up on our behalf .   Lately I have noticed that you , and another young chap , Konstantin Kisin ,  along with Ben Shapiro , have been featuring prominently in the media .  I must say that you gentleman represent  the absolute pinnacle of the very arrogant pseudo-intellectualism that saddens me .  Of course ,   I don't hate you , since hate is a destructive   emotion I discarded decades ago.  ( You should consider doing the same , since hatred oozing from one's every pore is unbecoming .  )   I sincerely ask that you consider a career more suited to your talents , since commenting on world events is clearly way beyond your intellectual capacity  .    I offer this advice in the hope that it proves helpful , both to you and your viewers ,who deserve better . In fact , your viewers desperately need better in these troubled times .   Your feedback is most welcome , if you feel so inclined .   Have a nice day .",-1

949,@MultiChicagogirl,This was an amazing interview.  Youssef is a gift.  Thank you.,1
950,@Istandwithpeace,"I am disturbed by the question that Piers Morgan repeatedly asked Bassem, ""if not this way, how else could Israel have targeted Hamas in such a densely populated civilian situation."" Firstly, Bassem is not in the military, so this is an unfair question to ask him, let alone ask him multiple times. Secondly and most importantly, Israel's strategy has been devised 1) to make Gaza uninhabitable, 2) to minimise the loss of Israeli soldiers' lives and 3) to destroy Gaza as quickly as possible before the international community or regional enemies put pressure on Israel to stop. If the goal was only to destroy Hamas, Israel did not need to cut off civilian water, food, medical supplies and humanitarian aid. If the goal was only to destroy Hamas, Israel did not need to give civilians what the UN and human rights organisations have called unfeasible evacuation orders. The truth is if Israel really cared about Palestinian civilians, they would be slower and more deliberate in their attack eg. they would evacuate hospitals before bombing them, etc. Former U.S. commanders who fought in Iraq have been outspoken about this. The truth is Israel is not prepared to risk its own soldiers' lives in order to save Palestinian civilian lives. You tell me, Piers Morgan, why is an Israeli soldier's life worth more than a Palestinian civilian's life?",0

You explained your discomfort in the first interview and I salute you for you bravery, efforts and professional conduct in pursuing your conversation with Bessem. The conversation between you both is a lesson to us all in humility, human openness and friendliness without acrimony. Well done to both of you. This is what we need with this horrendous situation in Gaza - willingness to reach out, hear one another and recognise the mutual suffering, educate ourselves on both viewpoints and work together to solve this terrible situation in Gaza.",1

969,@ElanaEarthsea,"I learnt so much from this man, I defended his viewpoints when people were judging me for listening to his lectures. He should have the courage and integrity to admit he was wrong, that the relentless killings of innocent people are morally reprehensible, no matter the justifications out forth by Israel and the all powerful USA who are paying for this atrocious war. He blamed twitter for something he said. He is not retracting his statement, only that he should have said it better. This is a fall from grace I cannot forgive. There is tremendous scope for people to be people and for people to redeem themselves if they were wrong, but his lack of moral courage is unforgivable, especially because he lectures the world on Jung and the shadow and how the repressed and unintegrated aspects of the personal shadow play out in the real world when we are not conscious, and now with an enormous opportunity to say that it was indeed a vengeful and impulsive part of him that caused him to make that statement and that he is now going to reckon with his himself and be more conscious, he has taken the cowardly way out and blamed the platform for the fragmented and hypocritical part of himself that saw it fit to say something like this. I don't believe in cancel culture but I do believe that people such as himself should be accountable to the international community lest they be judged. Netanyahu is a war criminal and all those who support these war crimes are on the wrong side of history, but that is for time to tell. He still has an opportunity to say something better than what he is saying here, but he should say it before Netanyahu is jailed for war crimes, before he jumps on the bandwagon of international consensus and condemnation.",0

1846,@nethrelm,"So these people doing ""not white Thanksgiving"" are clearly unaware that turkey and corn are pretty standard Thanksgiving foods because turkey and corn are native to North America (Benjamin Franklin even wanted to make turkeys our national bird rather than the bald eagle) and Squanto taught the Pilgrims how to plant corn and other crops around the Plymouth area (because they were not familiar with the area or climate so they were struggling with this). We didn't bring turkeys or corn to North America, so by eliminating these Thanksgiving staples,  THEY are the ones engaging in ""erasure of indigenous culture"", as they would put it.

I am kind of on the fence in this issue because I've done a lot of research on both sides and I was just wondering if you think the humanitarian issues going on in the Gaza Strip is a result of Hamas misuse of humanitarian aid money from countries such as Qatar or is it a result of the blockade.

The issue is ""This conflict will have global ramifications...what's the best outcome, and what can others do about it?"" Because whether we like it or not, it's that sort of conflict. Remember, it is still the first large-scale war of conquest (because that's what it is) in Europe since the Second World War. If Russia unequivocally loses (losing its gains with the exception of Crimea), that spells bad news for war as blatant conquest and encourages...well, stability.",

Even my home country of Scotland is waving Hamas flags although that is not surprising when the leader is a Muslim, Hamas apologist (how the eff did that happen?) Mel Gibson must be ecstatic. He portrayed a hero of Scotland only to find many Scots shared his off screen views. That is, the dumb ones that could not point to the Gaza Strip on a map.
